why you add background-color to body where container has already applied that color and it was of 100vh so what is use to apply the background color to body


You're right that applying a background color to both the `body` and the `.container` might seem redundant since your `.container` already covers the entire viewport height (`100vh`) and has the same background color.

However, there are a couple of reasons why applying a background color to the `body` can still be useful:

### 1. **Fallback for Edge Cases:**
   - **Height Expansion**: If the content inside `.container` grows beyond `100vh` (for example, if you add more sections), the body background ensures that any overflow beyond the `.container` is still covered by the same background color. This prevents any mismatch in background color if the page grows taller than expected.
   - **Responsive Layouts**: On smaller screens or devices where the viewport height is shorter, the content might stretch the page. The body’s background color acts as a fallback in such scenarios, keeping the color consistent.

### 2. **Safety Net:**
   - **Browser-specific Rendering**: Some older or less-common browsers might have quirks where the container doesn’t always cover the full viewport, especially if CSS properties are interpreted slightly differently. A background on the `body` ensures that there's a color fallback for such situations.
   - **Loading Behavior**: When a page loads, sometimes the `body` might render before the container due to layout calculations or external resources loading (like fonts or images). Having the body’s background color ensures that users see the intended background immediately, even if the container hasn't rendered fully.

### Conclusion:
If you are sure that your `.container` will always cover the full page and that no overflow or layout changes will require background coverage beyond it, you can omit the background color on the `body`. It’s mostly an extra layer of precaution for edge cases.

Would you like to keep it simpler by removing the body background, or do you want to keep it for safety?
