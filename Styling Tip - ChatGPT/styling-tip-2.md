why you add gap of 2rem in .top_section. is it necessary ?

The `gap: 2rem` in the `.top_section` was added to ensure that there is consistent spacing between the child elements (image and text container) within the flexbox. However, it's not strictly **necessary** unless you want to control the space between these elements for a better visual layout.

### Why Add `gap: 2rem`?

1. **Control Spacing Between Items**:
   - If you don’t add a `gap`, the image and the text might appear too close to each other, which could make the layout feel cluttered or harder to read. The `gap` ensures there’s enough breathing room between these two elements (image and text), improving readability and aesthetics.
  
2. **Responsive Design**:
   - When the layout changes (especially in media queries where the elements stack vertically), the `gap` helps to maintain consistent spacing between elements, regardless of whether they are arranged side by side or vertically.

### Is It Necessary?

- **Not absolutely necessary** if you’re happy with how the elements look without the gap. Flexbox already aligns elements, but without `gap`, you might have to manage the spacing through **margins** or **padding**, which could become harder to maintain across different screen sizes.
  
- If you find that the default spacing looks good without the gap, feel free to remove it. Here's the updated section without the gap:

```css
.top_section {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    margin-top: 10rem;
    /* gap: 2rem; */ /* Removed this */
}
```

### When Should You Use `gap`?

- **If you want flexible, consistent spacing** between flex items, especially in complex layouts where multiple elements need spacing without adding extra margins or padding.
  
- **For vertical stacking layouts in mobile views**, using `gap` can help maintain consistent spacing without needing to add specific margin rules in every media query.

Let me know if you want to keep or remove it depending on how the layout looks!
